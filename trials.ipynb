It’s also a good moment to take stock of where we \\nstand and where we’re headed.\\nAt Bajaj Finserv Asset Management Limited, September \\nmarked an important milestone. Bajaj Finserv Flexi  Cap Fund^ \\ncompleted two years since launch in August end. In this short \\nspan, it has grown to become the largest fund in our product \\nsuite, with AUM exceeding ₹5,400 crores*, reinforcing the \\nresilience of our investment approach.\\nBajaj Finserv Flexi Cap Fund is built on the principle of \\ninvesting in MEGATRENDS- long-term shifts that shape \\nindustries and consumer behaviour. Our strategy is \\ngrowth-oriented, focusing on companies that are \\nwell-positioned to beneﬁt from these trends. We’ve stayed \\ntrue to the fund’s label and objective, and the results reﬂect \\nthat discipline. We appreciate the trust our investors and \\ndistribution partners have placed in us, and strive to deliver \\nperformance with transparency and consistency.\\nLooking ahead, we see several positive indicators in the Indian \\neconomy. Consumer demand is improving, credit growth is \\npicking up, and macroeconomic data is turning favourable. \\nThese trends suggest a strong second half of the year. One \\nsector that stands out in this environment is Banking and \\nFinancial Services. It’s the largest sector in the ﬁnancial \\nmarkets and plays a central role in driving economic activity. \\nIts performance has a direct impact on broader market \\nsentiment and growth. We believe this sector is \\nwell-positioned for an upswing and are watching it closely for \\ninvestment opportunities.\\nAnother area gaining traction is our Savings+ proposition. \\nBajaj Finserv AMC is the ﬁrst asset management company to \\nintroduce a solution like this. Savings+ is designed to help \\ninvestors earn relatively better* potential   returns on idle \\nmoney, higher than savings accounts. It offers a simple way to \\nmake funds more productive without compromising on \\nliquidity. As awareness grows, we encourage investors and \\ndistributors to explore this offering and consider how it can ﬁt \\ninto their ﬁnancial plans.\\nSavings+ is especially useful for those who want to keep their \\nmoney accessible but still earn competitive returns. \\nAt Bajaj Finserv AMC, our focus remains on building reliable, \\ninnovative, and investor-friendly solutions. We aim to help \\ninvestors grow their wealth over the long term and make \\ninformed decisions with conﬁdence.\\nWe also recognize the importance of staying connected with \\nour distribution partners. Your feedback and insights help us \\nimprove and adapt. Whether it’s product design, \\ncommunication, or service delivery, we value your input and \\nstrive to build strong, collaborative relationships.\\nWe remain optimistic about the opportunities ahead. Market \\nconditions are evolving, and while challenges remain, there is \\nalso room for growth. Our team continues to monitor trends, \\nassess risks, and identify areas where we can add value \\nthrough thoughtful strategies.\\nDiwali is a time of renewal and hope. On behalf of everyone at \\nBajaj Finserv AMC, I wish you and your families a safe, happy, d \\nprosperous festive season. Thank you for your continued \\nsupport and trust.

It involved studying the behavior of \\nchildren who were 4 to 5 years old. Each child was brought into \\nthe room which had a table and a chair. The child was seated, \\nand a marshmallow was placed in front of him/her on the \\ntable. The researcher would tell the child that he would leave \\nthe room for some time. The child can have the marshmallow. \\nBut when the researcher returns, if the child has not eaten the \\nmarshmallow, he/she would get an additional marshmallow as \\na reward.\\nThe choice for every child was: Eat one now or have two later. \\nTypically, the child would be left in the room for 15 minutes. \\nSome children gave into the temptation quickly and ate the \\nmarshmallow as soon as the researcher left. Some struggled \\nfor a few minutes, trying to hold themselves back but \\nultimately gave in and gulped it down. Few kids were able to \\nresist long enough to earn their reward.\\nInteresting experiment but what makes it so great? The \\nimportant ﬁndings of the experiment came about only after \\nmany years! The researchers tracked the kids for years and \\nstudied how they performed in life on many different \\nparameters. The kids who delayed gratiﬁcation and waited to \\nreceive the second marshmallow ended up having better \\ngrades in school, higher educational attainment, lower \\nlikelihood of obesity, better social skills and did well on life’s \\nother measures.\\nThe temptation in investing\\nDo adults fare better than the kids in such situations? Well, the \\ntemptations are different but many of us easily give into them, \\nacting on impulse. In investing, the strongest desire that we \\nneed to ﬁght is the desire to make quick short-term returns. A \\nlot of investors enter the markets with the hope of making a \\n‘fast buck’. Especially when the market returns look good in \\nthe rear view mirror (like they do today), investors come in, \\nbelieving the future holds the same returns for them. These \\ninvestors move their focus from business research to market \\ntiming. This doesn’t in any way yield good results in the longer \\nterm. Plus, if the investors get their hands on some such \\n‘bonanza’ stock, the quantity they end up owning and/or the \\nprice they enter at, chasing the herd, does little to change \\ntheir long-term compounding of the investment effort.\\nAs the primary markets get active during bull markets, IPO \\n(Initial Public Offering) ﬂipping strategies also resurface. Here \\nthe investors want to apply for an issue only to sell it on listing \\nfor a quick proﬁt. Many don’t even understand what business \\nthe company owns. Prices become just numbers and screen \\nbecomes a video game. Typically, the ﬁrst set of primary issues \\nare good quality and are reasonably priced. As frenzy picks up, \\ncompanies with substandard fundamentals come to the \\nmarket with highly priced issuances. Investors’ due diligence \\ndeteriorates and scepticism (which is a useful tool for \\ninvesting) diminishes. And losses ensure wiping away any \\nsuperior return made in the strategy. Leveraged investors of \\ncourse suffer more.\\nBenjamin Graham talks about this short-term mindset as \\nspeculation rather than investment in his book ‘The Intelligent \\nInvestor’. It is like treating stocks as lottery tickets rather than \\nbusinesses.\\nWhat makes us think short-term and what can we do about \\nit\\nThe most common reason for short term thinking is recency \\nbias. We are affected by vivid stock price movements in the \\nshort term and we expect the same to continue. In doing so, \\nwe tend to ignore base rates (average long-term returns). \\nOverconﬁdence is another important reason for trading in the \\nshort term. People tend to overestimate their ability to \\nforecast short term market movements or market timing. \\nStress on performance and fear of missing out (FOMO) also \\ntend to make people think near term and react to noise rather \\nthan fundamentals.\\nThe lure of short-term returns is strong and takes a lot of \\ndiscipline and effort to resist. Keeping positive nudges around \\nto think about long term can help. The investment process \\nshould have tool like a checklist which help identify these \\nbiases and address them. One can also pre-commit to certain \\nsteps in investment to avoid taking decision in the hot state.\\nIn a follow up study to the Stanford marshmallow experiment, \\nsome researchers gave the children an attractive toy to \\ndistract them from staring at the marshmallow all the time. \\nThat seems to have worked. A majority of the children that had \\nthe option of playing with the toy while they were waiting were \\nable to resist eating the ﬁrst marshmallow. Maybe there lies an \\nanswer for investors too. The key is fruitful distractions - \\nrather than looking at the prices and updating portfolios all the \\ntime, invest time in reading about businesses and ideas that \\ncan help improve long-term investment outcomes. A good \\ninvestment process combined with patience and optimism will \\neventually lead to long-term wealth creation.\\nNimesh Chandan\\nCIO, Bajaj Finserv AMC'),\n",

The Nifty closed in green (up 0.8% MoM) in Sep’25 after two \\nstraight months of decline. Despite foreign outﬂows, domestic institutional and retail investors remained strong buyers, lending \\nstability to the market. With government reforms and the RBI working in tandem to ensure adequate liquidity through calibrated \\noperations, the underlying growth cycle appears to be on a ﬁrm footing. The Q2 FY26 GDP growth at 7.8% further underscores \\nIndia’s economic resilience and the strength of its domestic fundamentals, reﬂecting healthy momentum across manufacturing, \\nservices and investment activity.\\nThe interplay between tariff negotiations, festival-led consumption momentum and Q2 corporate earnings will potentially \\ninﬂuence the market direction in October. Festive-season demand, the lagged impact of GST rate cuts and stable macro \\nconditions should sustain consumption momentum, particularly across discretionary, auto and consumer durable segments. \\nCorporate results for Q2 FY26 will be closely watched to gauge the extent of margin recovery and demand resilience, especially in \\nmanufacturing, BFSI and consumption-led sectors. \\nOn a broader level, India’s economic strength continues to be underpinned by private consumption which contributes nearly \\ntwo-thirds of GDP supported by rising per capita income, a healthy household balance sheet and an expanding middle class \\ndriving premiumization across sectors, especially in autos, food, healthcare and wellness. Meanwhile, energy transition- marked \\nby accelerated renewable capacity addition, digitization and ﬁnancialization and China+1 manufacturing opportunities remain \\nstrong structural themes. While global trade and commodity volatility may cause short-term swings, India’s diversiﬁed growth \\nbase, resilient domestic demand and policy continuity are expected to keep the market tone positive for the month.\\nOur portfolio remains positioned towards domestic cyclicals and high-quality businesses with limited export exposure and robust \\nearnings visibility, ensuring resilience amid market volatility and global uncertainties. Large-cap and ﬂexi-cap funds continue to \\nstand out, supported by favorable valuations and steady earnings potential. Meanwhile, mid- and small-cap exposures are \\nmaintained selectively, emphasizing quality and consistent performance. Multi-asset, balanced advantage, and arbitrage \\nstrategies continue to enhance diversiﬁcation. Consumption is expected to gain further momentum, aided by recent GST \\nreductions and the ongoing festive season. Healthcare remains relatively stable, with diversiﬁed exposure and favorable generics \\npositioning helping offset tariff-related impacts.\\nThe MacroScope\\nSource: Bloomberg.

Despite these positives, yields remain elevated \\namid global and external uncertainties.\\nThe RBI MPC maintained the repo rate at 5.50% and a neutral stance, marking a second consecutive pause. The policy tone was balanced, \\nreﬂecting comfort with inﬂation below 3% and concern over a gradual growth moderation, with H2 FY26 GDP projected at 6.3%. The central \\nbank’s focus clearly remains on preserving external stability rather than adding further domestic stimulus.\\nGlobally, the US Fed cut rates by 25 bps to 4.00–4.25%, its ﬁrst move of 2025, citing softer labor data and sticky inﬂation. Chair Powell \\nemphasized ﬂexibility and data dependence. Meanwhile, US tariffs on Indian exports, muted FDI, and outﬂows have weighed on sentiment and \\nthe INR, reinforcing the RBI’s intent to maintain an adequate rate differential to protect currency stability.\\nSystem liquidity turned negative in September due to tax outﬂows, brieﬂy pushing the Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR) above the repo \\nrate. The RBI’s overnight Variable Rate Repo (VRR) operations provided partial relief. Liquidity should normalize in early October, supported by \\ngovernment spending, CRR reduction (effective Oct 4), and bond maturities. Even without a policy cut, these factors should ease short-term \\nrates and improve transmission. The H2 borrowing calendar remains in line with budget estimates, though reduced long-bond supply could \\nnarrow 30y–10y spreads.\\nWith policy stability, controlled inﬂation, and liquidity normalization, the debt market backdrop remains constructive. The near-term focus is \\non the RBI’s communication on growth, liquidity, and the external account. Investors should maintain measured duration exposure and a bias \\ntoward high-quality accrual strategies as the market navigates this phase of cautious optimism.\\nInvestment Strategy\\nWith inﬂation benign, growth moderating, and external risks persisting, portfolios should emphasize quality and calibrated duration.\\n\\uf034Conservative investors: Liquid and Money Market Funds offer favorable accruals with minimal duration risk.\\n\\uf034Moderate investors: Banking & PSU Debt Funds provide a balance of yield and credit quality; spreads may compress as liquidity improves.\\n\\uf034Aggressive investors: Gilt Funds can be selectively added; a dovish pivot later in FY26 could unlock value in the 7–10-year segment.\\nThe MacroScope\\n\\uf034Banking system liquidity remained in surplus, recovering \\nfrom brief deﬁcits caused by GST and advance tax outﬂows \\nin the previous week. \\n\\uf034The RBI reaffirmed its use of the overnight weighted \\naverage call rate as the operating target under the revised \\nliquidity framework and will continue using tools like open \\nmarket operations, long-term variable rate repos/reverse \\nrepos, and forex swaps to manage durable liquidity. \\n\\uf034The central bank also removed the ceiling on lending \\nagainst listed debt securities, giving banks greater ﬂexibility \\nin credit extension.\\nBanking System Liquidity (in ₹ Bn)\\nSource: Bloomberg.

He is usually part of a larger team of fund managers and \\nresearch analysts.\\nApplication amount for fresh subscription: This is the minimum \\ninvestment amount for a new investor entering in a mutual fund \\nscheme.\\nMinimum Additional Amount: This is the minimum investment \\namount for an existing investor in a mutual fund scheme.\\nSIP: Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is an organized way of investing \\nin Mutual Fund. It helps in building long term wealth through a \\ndisciplined approach of investing at pre-deﬁned intervals ranging \\nfrom daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly. \\nNAV: Net asset value or NAV is the total asset value per unit of the \\nmutual fund after deducting all related and permissible expenses. The \\nNAV is calculated at the end of every business day and it is the value at \\nwhich investors enter or exit the mutual fund.\\nBenchmark: A group of securities, typically a market index, whose \\nperformance is used as a standard or benchmark to assess the \\nperformance of mutual funds and other investments. A few common \\nbenchmarks are the Nifty, Sensex, BSE 200, BSE 500, and 10-year \\nGsec. \\nEntry Load: To compensate the distributor or agent, a mutual fund \\nmay impose a sales charge or load at the time of entry and/or exit. A \\nmutual fund's entry load is charged when an investor buys its units. \\nNote: SEBI Master Circular for Mutual Funds dated May 19, 2023 has \\nabolished entry load and mandated that the upfront commission to \\ndistributors will be paid by the investor directly to the distributor, \\nbased on his assessment of various factors including the service \\nrendered by the distributor.\\nExit load: When an investor redeems mutual fund units, exit load is \\ncharged. At redemption, the exit load is subtracted from the current \\nNAV. \\nStandard deviation: Standard deviation is statistical measure of the \\nrange of an investment’s performance. When a mutual fund has a high \\nstandard deviation, it means its range of performance is wide, \\nimplying greater volatility.\\nSharpe Ratio: The Sharpe Ratio is measure of risk-adjusted returns. It \\nis calculated using standard deviation and excess return to determine \\nreward per unit of risk.\\nBeta: Beta is a measure of an investment’s volatility vis-à-vis the \\nmarket. A beta of greater than 1 implies that the security’s price will be \\nmore volatile than the market. Beta of less than 1 means that the \\nsecurity will be less volatile than the market.\\nJensen's Alpha: Measures a fund's excess return compared to its \\nexpected return based on market risk (Beta), indicating the manager's \\nskill. \\nInformation Ratio: Evaluates the risk-adjusted return of a fund \\ncompared to a benchmark, highlighting consistency in \\noutperformance.\\nAUM: Assets under management or AUM refers to the recent \\ncumulative market value of investments managed by Mutual \\nfund or any investment ﬁrm.\\n \\nHoldings: The holdings or the portfolio is a mutual fund’s latest or \\nupdated reported statement of investments/securities. These are \\nusually displayed in terms of percentage to net assets or the rupee \\nvalue or both. The objective is to give investors an idea of where their \\nmoney is being invested by the fund manager.\\nNature of Scheme: The investment objective and underlying invest-\\nments determine the nature of the mutual fund scheme. For instance, \\na mutual fund that aims at generating capital appreciation by invest-\\ning in stock markets is an equity fund or growth fund. Likewise, a \\nmutual fund that aims at capital preservation by investing in debt \\nmarkets is a debt fund or income fund. Each of these categories may \\nhave sub-categories.\\n                                    \\nRating Proﬁle: Mutual funds invest in securities after evaluating their \\ncredit worthiness as disclosed by the ratings. A depiction of the \\nmutual fund in various investments based on their rating becomes the \\nrating proﬁle of the fund. Typically, this is a feature of debt funds.\\nMacaulay Duration: Macaulay Duration is a measure of how long it \\ntakes for the price of a bond to be repaid by its internal cash ﬂows. \\nMacaulay Duration is used only for an instrument with ﬁxed cash \\nﬂows. Modiﬁed Duration as the name suggests, is a modiﬁed version of \\nthe Macaulay model that accounts for changing interest rates.\\nModiﬁed Duration: Modiﬁed duration is the price sensitivity and the \\npercentage change in price for a unit change in yield.\\nAverage Maturity: A bond's maturity date indicates the speciﬁc future \\ndate on which an investor gets his principal back i.e. the borrowed \\namount is repaid in full. Average Maturity is the weighted average of all \\nthe current maturities of the debt securities held in the fund.\\nYield to Maturity: The yield to maturity or the YTM is the rate of return \\nanticipated on a bond if held until maturity. It is expressed as an \\nannual rate. The YTM factors in the bond’s current market price, par \\nvalue, couple interest rate and time to maturity\\nIDCW: Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal option or IDCW can \\nbe distributed out of investors’ capital (Equalization Reserve), which is \\npart of the sale price that represents realized gains.\\nP/E Ratio: The price-earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) is the relation between \\na company’s share price and earnings per share (EPS). It denotes what \\nthe market is willing to pay for a company’s proﬁts.\\nP/BV: The price-to-book ratio compares a company's market value to \\nits book value. The market value of a company is its share price \\nmultiplied by the number of outstanding shares.\\nIDCW Yield: The dividend yield is a ﬁnancial ratio that shows how much \\na company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price.\\nInterest Rate Swap (IRS): An interest rate swap is a forward contract \\nin which one stream of future interest payments is exchanged for \\nanother based on a speciﬁed principal amount. Interest rate swaps \\nusually involve the exchange of a ﬁxed interest rate for a ﬂoating rate, \\nor vice versa, to reduce or increase exposure to ﬂuctuations in interest \\nrates.\\nPotential Risk Class (PRC) Matrix: In reference to SEBI Master Circular \\nfor Mutual Funds dated May 19, 2023, all debt schemes will be \\nclassiﬁed in terms of a Potential Risk Class matrix which consists of \\nparameters based on maximum interest rate risk (measured by \\nMacaulay Duration (MD) of the scheme) and maximum credit risk \\n(measured by Credit Risk Value (CRV) of the scheme). \\nHOW TO READ A MUTUAL FUND\\nFACTSHEET?\\n10\"),\n",

Ideal earnings are forward-\\nlooking estimations, while ideal valuations are comparative, offering a realistic assessment rather than absolute measures. This\\nrobust analysis forms the backbone of our model, ensuring a sound foundation for asset allocation.\\nBehavioural Indicator:\\nThe differentiation in our model lies in the behavioural indicator, which measures behavioural and sentimental trends in the market\\nby monitoring four key factors: currencies, commodities, bonds, and equities.

It’s also a good moment to take stock of where we \\nstand and where we’re headed.\\nAt Bajaj Finserv Asset Management Limited, September \\nmarked an important milestone. Bajaj Finserv Flexi  Cap Fund^ \\ncompleted two years since launch in August end. In this short \\nspan, it has grown to become the largest fund in our product \\nsuite, with AUM exceeding ₹5,400 crores*, reinforcing the \\nresilience of our investment approach.\\nBajaj Finserv Flexi Cap Fund is built on the principle of \\ninvesting in MEGATRENDS- long-term shifts that shape \\nindustries and consumer behaviour. Our strategy is \\ngrowth-oriented, focusing on companies that are \\nwell-positioned to beneﬁt from these trends. We’ve stayed \\ntrue to the fund’s label and objective, and the results reﬂect \\nthat discipline. We appreciate the trust our investors and \\ndistribution partners have placed in us, and strive to deliver \\nperformance with transparency and consistency.\\nLooking ahead, we see several positive indicators in the Indian \\neconomy. Consumer demand is improving, credit growth is \\npicking up, and macroeconomic data is turning favourable. \\nThese trends suggest a strong second half of the year. One \\nsector that stands out in this environment is Banking and \\nFinancial Services. It’s the largest sector in the ﬁnancial \\nmarkets and plays a central role in driving economic activity. \\nIts performance has a direct impact on broader market \\nsentiment and growth. We believe this sector is \\nwell-positioned for an upswing and are watching it closely for \\ninvestment opportunities.\\nAnother area gaining traction is our Savings+ proposition. \\nBajaj Finserv AMC is the ﬁrst asset management company to \\nintroduce a solution like this. Savings+ is designed to help \\ninvestors earn relatively better* potential   returns on idle \\nmoney, higher than savings accounts. It offers a simple way to \\nmake funds more productive without compromising on \\nliquidity. As awareness grows, we encourage investors and \\ndistributors to explore this offering and consider how it can ﬁt \\ninto their ﬁnancial plans.\\nSavings+ is especially useful for those who want to keep their \\nmoney accessible but still earn competitive returns. \\nAt Bajaj Finserv AMC, our focus remains on building reliable, \\ninnovative, and investor-friendly solutions. We aim to help \\ninvestors grow their wealth over the long term and make \\ninformed decisions with conﬁdence.\\nWe also recognize the importance of staying connected with \\nour distribution partners. Your feedback and insights help us \\nimprove and adapt. Whether it’s product design, \\ncommunication, or service delivery, we value your input and \\nstrive to build strong, collaborative relationships.\\nWe remain optimistic about the opportunities ahead. Market \\nconditions are evolving, and while challenges remain, there is \\nalso room for growth. Our team continues to monitor trends, \\nassess risks, and identify areas where we can add value \\nthrough thoughtful strategies.\\nDiwali is a time of renewal and hope. On behalf of everyone at \\nBajaj Finserv AMC, I wish you and your families a safe, happy, d \\nprosperous festive season. Thank you for your continued \\nsupport and trust.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\bajaj_finserv_factsheet_Oct.pdf'}, page_content='FROM THE CIO’s DESK\\n4\\nSince I am writing this during the World Investor Week, I \\nthought of taking a topic which is most discussed these days \\namong investors. \\nIn 1970  , Psychologist Walter Mischel conducted one of the \\nmost famous experiments in psychology called the Stanford \\nMarshmallow Experiment. It involved studying the behavior of \\nchildren who were 4 to 5 years old. Each child was brought into \\nthe room which had a table and a chair. The child was seated, \\nand a marshmallow was placed in front of him/her on the \\ntable. The researcher would tell the child that he would leave \\nthe room for some time. The child can have the marshmallow. \\nBut when the researcher returns, if the child has not eaten the \\nmarshmallow, he/she would get an additional marshmallow as \\na reward.\\nThe choice for every child was: Eat one now or have two later. \\nTypically, the child would be left in the room for 15 minutes. \\nSome children gave into the temptation quickly and ate the \\nmarshmallow as soon as the researcher left. Some struggled \\nfor a few minutes, trying to hold themselves back but \\nultimately gave in and gulped it down. Few kids were able to \\nresist long enough to earn their reward.\\nInteresting experiment but what makes it so great? The \\nimportant ﬁndings of the experiment came about only after \\nmany years! The researchers tracked the kids for years and \\nstudied how they performed in life on many different \\nparameters. The kids who delayed gratiﬁcation and waited to \\nreceive the second marshmallow ended up having better \\ngrades in school, higher educational attainment, lower \\nlikelihood of obesity, better social skills and did well on life’s \\nother measures.\\nThe temptation in investing\\nDo adults fare better than the kids in such situations? Well, the \\ntemptations are different but many of us easily give into them, \\nacting on impulse. In investing, the strongest desire that we \\nneed to ﬁght is the desire to make quick short-term returns. A \\nlot of investors enter the markets with the hope of making a \\n‘fast buck’. Especially when the market returns look good in \\nthe rear view mirror (like they do today), investors come in, \\nbelieving the future holds the same returns for them. These \\ninvestors move their focus from business research to market \\ntiming. This doesn’t in any way yield good results in the longer \\nterm. Plus, if the investors get their hands on some such \\n‘bonanza’ stock, the quantity they end up owning and/or the \\nprice they enter at, chasing the herd, does little to change \\ntheir long-term compounding of the investment effort.\\nAs the primary markets get active during bull markets, IPO \\n(Initial Public Offering) ﬂipping strategies also resurface. Here \\nthe investors want to apply for an issue only to sell it on listing \\nfor a quick proﬁt. Many don’t even understand what business \\nthe company owns. Prices become just numbers and screen \\nbecomes a video game. Typically, the ﬁrst set of primary issues \\nare good quality and are reasonably priced. As frenzy picks up, \\ncompanies with substandard fundamentals come to the \\nmarket with highly priced issuances. Investors’ due diligence \\ndeteriorates and scepticism (which is a useful tool for \\ninvesting) diminishes. And losses ensure wiping away any \\nsuperior return made in the strategy. Leveraged investors of \\ncourse suffer more.\\nBenjamin Graham talks about this short-term mindset as \\nspeculation rather than investment in his book ‘The Intelligent \\nInvestor’. It is like treating stocks as lottery tickets rather than \\nbusinesses.\\nWhat makes us think short-term and what can we do about \\nit\\nThe most common reason for short term thinking is recency \\nbias. We are affected by vivid stock price movements in the \\nshort term and we expect the same to continue. In doing so, \\nwe tend to ignore base rates (average long-term returns). \\nOverconﬁdence is another important reason for trading in the \\nshort term. People tend to overestimate their ability to \\nforecast short term market movements or market timing. \\nStress on performance and fear of missing out (FOMO) also \\ntend to make people think near term and react to noise rather \\nthan fundamentals.\\nThe lure of short-term returns is strong and takes a lot of \\ndiscipline and effort to resist. Keeping positive nudges around \\nto think about long term can help. The investment process \\nshould have tool like a checklist which help identify these \\nbiases and address them. One can also pre-commit to certain \\nsteps in investment to avoid taking decision in the hot state.\\nIn a follow up study to the Stanford marshmallow experiment, \\nsome researchers gave the children an attractive toy to \\ndistract them from staring at the marshmallow all the time. \\nThat seems to have worked. A majority of the children that had \\nthe option of playing with the toy while they were waiting were \\nable to resist eating the ﬁrst marshmallow. Maybe there lies an \\nanswer for investors too. The key is fruitful distractions - \\nrather than looking at the prices and updating portfolios all the \\ntime, invest time in reading about businesses and ideas that \\ncan help improve long-term investment outcomes. A good \\ninvestment process combined with patience and optimism will \\neventually lead to long-term wealth creation.\\nNimesh Chandan\\nCIO, Bajaj Finserv AMC'),\n",

The Nifty closed in green (up 0.8% MoM) in Sep’25 after two \\nstraight months of decline. Despite foreign outﬂows, domestic institutional and retail investors remained strong buyers, lending \\nstability to the market. With government reforms and the RBI working in tandem to ensure adequate liquidity through calibrated \\noperations, the underlying growth cycle appears to be on a ﬁrm footing. The Q2 FY26 GDP growth at 7.8% further underscores \\nIndia’s economic resilience and the strength of its domestic fundamentals, reﬂecting healthy momentum across manufacturing, \\nservices and investment activity.\\nThe interplay between tariff negotiations, festival-led consumption momentum and Q2 corporate earnings will potentially \\ninﬂuence the market direction in October. Festive-season demand, the lagged impact of GST rate cuts and stable macro \\nconditions should sustain consumption momentum, particularly across discretionary, auto and consumer durable segments. \\nCorporate results for Q2 FY26 will be closely watched to gauge the extent of margin recovery and demand resilience, especially in \\nmanufacturing, BFSI and consumption-led sectors. \\nOn a broader level, India’s economic strength continues to be underpinned by private consumption which contributes nearly \\ntwo-thirds of GDP supported by rising per capita income, a healthy household balance sheet and an expanding middle class \\ndriving premiumization across sectors, especially in autos, food, healthcare and wellness. Meanwhile, energy transition- marked \\nby accelerated renewable capacity addition, digitization and ﬁnancialization and China+1 manufacturing opportunities remain \\nstrong structural themes. While global trade and commodity volatility may cause short-term swings, India’s diversiﬁed growth \\nbase, resilient domestic demand and policy continuity are expected to keep the market tone positive for the month.\\nOur portfolio remains positioned towards domestic cyclicals and high-quality businesses with limited export exposure and robust \\nearnings visibility, ensuring resilience amid market volatility and global uncertainties. Large-cap and ﬂexi-cap funds continue to \\nstand out, supported by favorable valuations and steady earnings potential. Meanwhile, mid- and small-cap exposures are \\nmaintained selectively, emphasizing quality and consistent performance. Multi-asset, balanced advantage, and arbitrage \\nstrategies continue to enhance diversiﬁcation.

Despite these positives, yields remain elevated \\namid global and external uncertainties.\\nThe RBI MPC maintained the repo rate at 5.50% and a neutral stance, marking a second consecutive pause. The policy tone was balanced, \\nreﬂecting comfort with inﬂation below 3% and concern over a gradual growth moderation, with H2 FY26 GDP projected at 6.3%. The central \\nbank’s focus clearly remains on preserving external stability rather than adding further domestic stimulus.\\nGlobally, the US Fed cut rates by 25 bps to 4.00–4.25%, its ﬁrst move of 2025, citing softer labor data and sticky inﬂation. Chair Powell \\nemphasized ﬂexibility and data dependence. Meanwhile, US tariffs on Indian exports, muted FDI, and outﬂows have weighed on sentiment and \\nthe INR, reinforcing the RBI’s intent to maintain an adequate rate differential to protect currency stability.\\nSystem liquidity turned negative in September due to tax outﬂows, brieﬂy pushing the Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR) above the repo \\nrate. The RBI’s overnight Variable Rate Repo (VRR) operations provided partial relief. Liquidity should normalize in early October, supported by \\ngovernment spending, CRR reduction (effective Oct 4), and bond maturities. Even without a policy cut, these factors should ease short-term \\nrates and improve transmission. The H2 borrowing calendar remains in line with budget estimates, though reduced long-bond supply could \\nnarrow 30y–10y spreads.\\nWith policy stability, controlled inﬂation, and liquidity normalization, the debt market backdrop remains constructive. The near-term focus is \\non the RBI’s communication on growth, liquidity, and the external account. Investors should maintain measured duration exposure and a bias \\ntoward high-quality accrual strategies as the market navigates this phase of cautious optimism.\\nInvestment Strategy\\nWith inﬂation benign, growth moderating, and external risks persisting, portfolios should emphasize quality and calibrated duration.\\n\\uf034Conservative investors: Liquid and Money Market Funds offer favorable accruals with minimal duration risk.\\n\\uf034Moderate investors: Banking & PSU Debt Funds provide a balance of yield and credit quality; spreads may compress as liquidity improves.\\n\\uf034Aggressive investors: Gilt Funds can be selectively added; a dovish pivot later in FY26 could unlock value in the 7–10-year segment.\\nThe MacroScope\\n\\uf034Banking system liquidity remained in surplus, recovering \\nfrom brief deﬁcits caused by GST and advance tax outﬂows \\nin the previous week. \\n\\uf034The RBI reaffirmed its use of the overnight weighted \\naverage call rate as the operating target under the revised \\nliquidity framework and will continue using tools like open \\nmarket operations, long-term variable rate repos/reverse \\nrepos, and forex swaps to manage durable liquidity. \\n\\uf034The central bank also removed the ceiling on lending \\nagainst listed debt securities, giving banks greater ﬂexibility \\nin credit extension.\\nBanking System Liquidity (in ₹ Bn)\\nSource: Bloomberg.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\bajaj_finserv_factsheet_Oct.pdf'}, page_content=\"Fund Manager: An employee of an asset management company such \\nas mutual fund or life insurer, who manages investments of the \\nscheme. He is usually part of a larger team of fund managers and \\nresearch analysts.\\nApplication amount for fresh subscription: This is the minimum \\ninvestment amount for a new investor entering in a mutual fund \\nscheme.\\nMinimum Additional Amount: This is the minimum investment \\namount for an existing investor in a mutual fund scheme.\\nSIP: Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is an organized way of investing \\nin Mutual Fund. It helps in building long term wealth through a \\ndisciplined approach of investing at pre-deﬁned intervals ranging \\nfrom daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly. \\nNAV: Net asset value or NAV is the total asset value per unit of the \\nmutual fund after deducting all related and permissible expenses. The \\nNAV is calculated at the end of every business day and it is the value at \\nwhich investors enter or exit the mutual fund.\\nBenchmark: A group of securities, typically a market index, whose \\nperformance is used as a standard or benchmark to assess the \\nperformance of mutual funds and other investments. A few common \\nbenchmarks are the Nifty, Sensex, BSE 200, BSE 500, and 10-year \\nGsec. \\nEntry Load: To compensate the distributor or agent, a mutual fund \\nmay impose a sales charge or load at the time of entry and/or exit. A \\nmutual fund's entry load is charged when an investor buys its units. \\nNote: SEBI Master Circular for Mutual Funds dated May 19, 2023 has \\nabolished entry load and mandated that the upfront commission to \\ndistributors will be paid by the investor directly to the distributor, \\nbased on his assessment of various factors including the service \\nrendered by the distributor.\\nExit load: When an investor redeems mutual fund units, exit load is \\ncharged. At redemption, the exit load is subtracted from the current \\nNAV. \\nStandard deviation: Standard deviation is statistical measure of the \\nrange of an investment’s performance. When a mutual fund has a high \\nstandard deviation, it means its range of performance is wide, \\nimplying greater volatility.\\nSharpe Ratio: The Sharpe Ratio is measure of risk-adjusted returns. It \\nis calculated using standard deviation and excess return to determine \\nreward per unit of risk.\\nBeta: Beta is a measure of an investment’s volatility vis-à-vis the \\nmarket. A beta of greater than 1 implies that the security’s price will be \\nmore volatile than the market. Beta of less than 1 means that the \\nsecurity will be less volatile than the market.\\nJensen's Alpha: Measures a fund's excess return compared to its \\nexpected return based on market risk (Beta), indicating the manager's \\nskill. \\nInformation Ratio: Evaluates the risk-adjusted return of a fund \\ncompared to a benchmark, highlighting consistency in \\noutperformance.\\nAUM: Assets under management or AUM refers to the recent \\ncumulative market value of investments managed by Mutual \\nfund or any investment ﬁrm.\\n \\nHoldings: The holdings or the portfolio is a mutual fund’s latest or \\nupdated reported statement of investments/securities. These are \\nusually displayed in terms of percentage to net assets or the rupee \\nvalue or both. The objective is to give investors an idea of where their \\nmoney is being invested by the fund manager.\\nNature of Scheme: The investment objective and underlying invest-\\nments determine the nature of the mutual fund scheme. For instance, \\na mutual fund that aims at generating capital appreciation by invest-\\ning in stock markets is an equity fund or growth fund. Likewise, a \\nmutual fund that aims at capital preservation by investing in debt \\nmarkets is a debt fund or income fund. Each of these categories may \\nhave sub-categories.\\n                                    \\nRating Proﬁle: Mutual funds invest in securities after evaluating their \\ncredit worthiness as disclosed by the ratings. A depiction of the \\nmutual fund in various investments based on their rating becomes the \\nrating proﬁle of the fund. Typically, this is a feature of debt funds.\\nMacaulay Duration: Macaulay Duration is a measure of how long it \\ntakes for the price of a bond to be repaid by its internal cash ﬂows. \\nMacaulay Duration is used only for an instrument with ﬁxed cash \\nﬂows. Modiﬁed Duration as the name suggests, is a modiﬁed version of \\nthe Macaulay model that accounts for changing interest rates.\\nModiﬁed Duration: Modiﬁed duration is the price sensitivity and the \\npercentage change in price for a unit change in yield.\\nAverage Maturity: A bond's maturity date indicates the speciﬁc future \\ndate on which an investor gets his principal back i.e. the borrowed \\namount is repaid in full. Average Maturity is the weighted average of all \\nthe current maturities of the debt securities held in the fund.\\nYield to Maturity: The yield to maturity or the YTM is the rate of return \\nanticipated on a bond if held until maturity. It is expressed as an \\nannual rate. The YTM factors in the bond’s current market price, par \\nvalue, couple interest rate and time to maturity\\nIDCW: Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal option or IDCW can \\nbe distributed out of investors’ capital (Equalization Reserve), which is \\npart of the sale price that represents realized gains.\\nP/E Ratio: The price-earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) is the relation between \\na company’s share price and earnings per share (EPS). It denotes what \\nthe market is willing to pay for a company’s proﬁts.\\nP/BV: The price-to-book ratio compares a company's market value to \\nits book value. The market value of a company is its share price \\nmultiplied by the number of outstanding shares.\\nIDCW Yield: The dividend yield is a ﬁnancial ratio that shows how much \\na company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price.\\nInterest Rate Swap (IRS): An interest rate swap is a forward contract \\nin which one stream of future interest payments is exchanged for \\nanother based on a speciﬁed principal amount. Interest rate swaps \\nusually involve the exchange of a ﬁxed interest rate for a ﬂoating rate, \\nor vice versa, to reduce or increase exposure to ﬂuctuations in interest \\nrates.\\nPotential Risk Class (PRC) Matrix: In reference to SEBI Master Circular \\nfor Mutual Funds dated May 19, 2023, all debt schemes will be \\nclassiﬁed in terms of a Potential Risk Class matrix which consists of \\nparameters based on maximum interest rate risk (measured by \\nMacaulay Duration (MD) of the scheme) and maximum credit risk \\n(measured by Credit Risk Value (CRV) of the scheme). \\nHOW TO READ A MUTUAL FUND\\nFACTSHEET?\\n10\"),\n",

Ideal earnings are forward-\\nlooking estimations, while ideal valuations are comparative, offering a realistic assessment rather than absolute measures. This\\nrobust analysis forms the backbone of our model, ensuring a sound foundation for asset allocation.\\nBehavioural Indicator:\\nThe differentiation in our model lies in the behavioural indicator, which measures behavioural and sentimental trends in the market\\nby monitoring four key factors: currencies, commodities, bonds, and equities.
